**Facilitators:** Christine Bell, Lucy Brownsdon and Dominic Wright –
Centre for Facilitation

**Location:** Kenwood Hall, Sheffield – check with Joanne the space we
have allocated

**Timing**: 9.00 – 18.00

The event will be in the style of a “hackathon” and will be practically
focused, intense and thought provoking whilst also providing an
opportunity for our team to further explore we work together in a
problem-solving environment. The event will give us an opportunity to
use our software tools and robot platforms to complete a practical
challenge whilst learning about the use of the Hackathon format and
about our team working skills.

**Benefits of Participating**

  - Working alongside other team members on a relevant problem-solving
    challenge that will require creative and collaborative team skills

  - Contribute your views about how to bring out the best of all members
    of the project team during the day and to take the learning from
    this back into daily project work

  - Contribute to the development of a demonstrator for the project and
    explore the use of the Hackathon format for wider
    academic/industrial community events

# Pre-Event Preparation

A short reflective activity will be sent in advance, so you have time to
prepare your thoughts about what you need from others to be at your best
in a collaborative environment. A short toolkit of techniques used in
collaborative groups will also be provided to refresh memories.

Relevant software will need to be downloaded in advance of the event.
One of the tools we will be using is a digital pinboard called Padlet.
It is fairly intuitive to use but if you like more information this
video provides an overview:
